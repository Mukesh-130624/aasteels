    description: "High-quality Tor Steel for construction.",
    detail:
      "Tor steel, also known as Cold Twisted Deformed (CTD) steel, was a pioneering product in the construction industry. After undergoing a heat treatment, these bars were cold-twisted and deformed to create surface irregularities. This process significantly increased the steel's yield strength and improved its bonding with concrete, preventing slippage and providing greater stability. Though newer technologies like TMT bars are now the industry standard, Tor steel played a vital role in advancing reinforced concrete construction. ",

    description: "Strong steel angles for building.",
    detail:
      "Steel angles are L-shaped structural steel components, also known as 'angle iron,' formed by rolling a single piece of steel into a 90-degree bend. Valued for their strength, durability, and versatility, they are one of the most widely used structural materials in construction and fabrication. ",

    name: "Channel",
    image: "/products/channel.jpg",
    description: "Steel channels for structural support.",
    detail:
      "Steel channels are structural metal products characterized by their distinctive C- or U-shaped cross-section. A channel consists of a broad, flat vertical section called the 'web' and two right-angled flanges extending from the top and bottom of one side. They are hot-rolled from carbon steel to achieve excellent durability and a high strength-to-weight ratio. These versatile steel sections are essential in construction, fabrication, and manufacturing, providing robust support and structural integrity across many applications. They can be easily cut, welded, and drilled to meet specific project needs. ",

    name: "Beam",
    image: "/products/beam.jpg",
    description: "Heavy-duty steel beams.",
    detail: `A steel beam is a structural element used in construction to support and distribute heavy loads. Made from high-strength structural steel, beams are central to a building's framework, providing the critical support needed for floors, ceilings, and roofs. 
      
    Features and benefits:
      High strength and durability: Steel beams can support immense weight over long spans, ensuring a structure's safety and stability.
      Versatility: Beams come in various shapes and sizes‚Äîsuch as I-beams (Universal Beams) and H-beams (Wide Flange Beams)‚Äîto suit specific design and load requirements.
      Flexibility in design: The inherent strength of steel allows for open, column-free spaces and unique architectural designs.
      Sustainability: Steel is a highly recyclable material, making it an environmentally friendly choice for construction. `,

    name: "Bars",
    image: "/products/bars.jpg",
    description: "Reinforced steel bars.",
    detail: `Reinforcement steel bars, also known as rebars, are an essential component of modern construction. Concrete is naturally strong under compression but weak under tension. When embedded in concrete, steel bars significantly increase its tensile strength, forming a robust and durable material called Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC). 
    This combination of steel and concrete creates a framework that can withstand heavy loads, temperature changes, and seismic forces, ensuring the long-term stability and safety of a structure. `,
